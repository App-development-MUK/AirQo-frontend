## Analytics

## What is Analytics
**Analytics** is one of the many products of [AirQo](https://airqo.net) designed based on specific user need. This front-end `dir` provides the presentation logic of the platform using lastest technologies.<br /> <br /> 
**Analytics Front-end** is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library. We chose this framework to give numerous flexibilities:<br />
- Rapid prototyping
- Resuable components
- Easy build, test, deploy process
- Enforces industry standard design patterns
- Guarantees stable code and maintenance
- etc.

## Installation and Usage 
1. **Run app locally in development mode:** Clone and `cd` to the project directory, you can run: <br />
`npm install` to install all the dependencies followed by `npm start`.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br />
**Other useful scripts:**<br />
`npm test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
`npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
2. **Running on a Cloud Computing Platform (GCE, AWS, Azure)‚Äù** You will build, upload and deploy the container image to a Kubernetes cluster on [Google Cloud Engine](https://cloud.google.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).
